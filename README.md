# Project-Source-Code

This code is designed for an ESP32 device that integrates health monitoring features. It interfaces with the MAX30102 sensor to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels. The collected data is displayed on an OLED screen for local visualization. Additionally, the code employs TinyGPS++ to acquire GPS coordinates. The device triggers a vibration motor based on heart rate ranges and communicates this data to the Blynk platform for remote monitoring. It facilitates real-time tracking of health metrics, making it suitable for healthcare and fitness applications.
